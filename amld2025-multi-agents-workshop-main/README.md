# Building Agents with LangGraph: From GPT to RAG and Multi-Agent Systems

This workshop is organized by [Visium](https://visium.ch/) for the [Applied Machine Learning Days (AMLD) 2025](https://2025.appliedmldays.org/) at EPFL. It demonstrates how to build sophisticated AI agents using LangChain and LangGraph frameworks.

## Workshop Overview
The workshop explores the progression from basic language models to complex multi-agent systems through hands-on examples in financial analysis.

### Part 1: Introduction to LangChain and RAG
Learn the basics of building AI applications with LangChain, including:
- Setting up a basic chatbot
- Understanding Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Working with vector databases
- Creating custom tools
- Implementing a RAG-enhanced financial advisor

### Part 2: Building a Multi-Agent System

Explore more sophisticated AI applications using LangGraph:
- Creating specialized AI agents
- Managing state and workflow
- Implementing agent communication
- Building a complete financial analysis system with multiple agents

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- OpenAI API key

### Environment Setup

To set up your Python environment:

#### Using Conda/Mamba
```bash
# Use mamba instead of conda if preferred
conda create -n financial-advisor python=3.12
conda activate financial-advisor
pip install -e .
```

#### Using venv
```bash
python -m venv .venv

# On Linux/Mac:
source .venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -e .
```

#### Using UV
```bash
uv sync
```

### Configuration

You'll need to configure your OpenAI API key. Here are two ways to do it:

Set it as an environment variable:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

Or store it in a `.env` file in your project root:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

### Development Environment

This workshop uses Jupyter notebooks. You can run them using:

- VS Code with the Python extension installed
- Jupyter Lab through the web interface  with `jupyter lab`

## Workshop Structure
- `S1 - Introduction to LangChain and RAG.ipynb`: First session covering LangChain basics and RAG implementation
- `S2 - Building a Multi-Agent System.ipynb`: Second session exploring multi-agent systems with LangGraph

## Data
The workshop uses a curated set of Bloomberg financial news articles for demonstration purposes. The data is stored in `data/bloomberg_financial_news_1k.pkl`.
